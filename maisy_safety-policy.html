    <h1>Standards Against Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)</h1>
    <p>Chatting Maisy is committed to fostering a safe and respectful digital environment. We strictly prohibit all forms of child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) on our platform. Our commitment includes:</p>
    <h2>1. Zero Tolerance Policy</h2>
    <p>Any content that depicts, promotes, or supports CSAE is strictly forbidden and will result in immediate action, including removal and reporting to the appropriate authorities.</p>
    <h2>2. Proactive Monitoring</h2>
    <p>We actively monitor for harmful content using both automated tools and human reviewers to identify and address any CSAE-related materials.</p>
    <h2>3. User Education and Reporting</h2>
    <p>We provide resources to educate users on recognizing and reporting CSAE content. A clear and accessible reporting mechanism is available within our app for users to flag such content.</p>
    <h2>4. Collaboration with Authorities</h2>
    <p>Chatting Maisy cooperates fully with law enforcement and child protection organizations to ensure timely intervention in addressing any CSAE violations.</p>
    <h2>5. Compliance with Global Standards</h2>
    <p>We align our policies and procedures with globally recognized frameworks, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to uphold the safety and dignity of children.</p>
    <p>Together, we aim to protect vulnerable individuals and create a secure and supportive community for all users.</p>
